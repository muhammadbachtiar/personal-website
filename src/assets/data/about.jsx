      Graduated with a GPA of 3.92 from Universitas Lampung? Yup, that's me! After 4 years of diving deep into <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">Informatics Engineering</strong>, I decided to focus heavily on <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">Software Engineering</strong>, with a sweet spot for <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">Website Development</strong>. Seriously, coding and building websites has been my thing throughout my time as a college student.

      Throughout my time in university, I didn't just stick to textbooks and lectures. I made sure to get involved in everything that could boost my skills. From <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">internships, independent studies, bootcamps,</strong> to <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">trainings</strong> and <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">seminars</strong>, I've been all in!

      One of the coolest experiences I had was interning as a <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">Web Developer Staff</strong> at <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">PT ASDP Indonesia Ferry (Persero)</strong>. I got to turn Quality Control division's needs into a web-based management system. Another exciting work experience was when I worked as a <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">Full Stack Web Developer</strong> at <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">PT PNM (Persero)</strong>. Together with my team and the stakeholders, we revamped a loan collateral management web using <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">ReactJS</strong>. It was intense, but also super fun to collaborate and see the project come to life!

      In another experience, I dove into learning fundamentals of web development using the <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">PERN Stack</strong> through the <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">SYNERGY Academy X BCA</strong> program. I also sharpened my <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">ReactJs</strong> skills in the <strong class="font-bold text-[#93DEFF]">Dicoding Indonesia X Kampus Merdeka Independent Study</strong> program.

      These experiences helped me not just on the technical side in website development, but also with soft skills like teamwork, communication, time management, and problem-solving
